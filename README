Before building the installer add the data folders to each package
One way to set it up is to have an install folder where LongQt-model,
and PyLongQt have already copied their install files copied to a directory
I use ~/install/<name>.
To set them up for the installer to build create links (soft links in linux/
osx, junctions in windows)
packages/LongQtmodel/data -> ~/install/LongQt-model
packages/PyLongQt/data -> ~/install/PyLongQt

To setup LongQt create ~/install/LongQt(/bin on windows)
and copy the executables there (.exe windows, .app osx)

Then modify the build scripts to point to your qt installation and run it
